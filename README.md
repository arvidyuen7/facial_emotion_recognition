# Facial Expression Classifier

### Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model to classify images with a person’s facial expression into five classes – angry, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.  The report compares the prediction accuracy of several types of machine learning models, including logistic regression, convolutional neural network, and pre-trained neural network.  I also discuss how the different models work.  This project was originally done as a part of a data science bootcamp in the spring of 2020.

Tools used: Sci-Kit Learn, Keras, Tensorflow, OpenCV
